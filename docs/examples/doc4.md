## Requirements {#requirements}

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12.13.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn --version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

## Installation {#installation}

- Install Node.js and npm from snap (the command will install both)

	`sudo snap install node --classic`

- Install Yarn via npm
	
	`npm install --global yarn`

- Check installation with
	
	Node.js: `node -v`

	npm: `npm -v`

	Yarn: `yarn -v`
